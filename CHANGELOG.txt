Remade all layouts
Changed default theme to green to match guidelines (all options still available in settings)
Added action buttons
Improved material themes
Changed swipe direction and transitions: you now swipe up to move forward and swipe down to move backwards (to prevent accidental swiping on the slider)
Percent input cannot be above or below slider limits
Fixed percent limits in the settings to catch incorrect input: it now makes sure the min < max
Improved percent text and slider live updates on percent screen
Remade some graphics
All values are rounded up (nothing smaller than 2 decimals, this will likely overcharge a little but its better than undercharging)
Trimmed the code
More safeguards for possible crashes
Squashed bugs
